Once upon a time, Joanne Cully semmed like every other girl growing up in her small Mormon community in Utah. She participated
in her church, worked hard in her afterschool job, excelled in school, and was thought to be the perfect young wife. However, Joanne had 
a secert that set her apart from her peers; Joanne had no desire to be the perfect young wife. Joanne thought eventually, when 
she was much older, maybe she'd want to be married. But she had just turned 18! She couldn't comprehend the idea. Instead, 
Joanne daydreamed of becoming a Marine Biologist in the South  of France. Joanne took French classes throughout high school, 
and she made it her prioity to become fulent, and so she did. She was nervous about the ideaof being married young, but 
she thought she'd still have some time. That was until right before her 18th birthday, her parents revealed that right after
she graduated, she would be married off to an elder at their church over twice her age, and he already had 3 other wives. 
 She was shocked, but spent little time mourning, instead she instantly sprung to action. Joanne decided her dreams should become 
 reality, and mastered a plan to leave Utah for France right after she graduates. She applied for a University in France, and got
 accepted. She got a student visa, bought an one way ticket to France...and all she had to do was wait. After planning her escape plan, she decided the day that she wanted to leave. After three days, Joanne woke up In the middle of the night and grabbed her stuff, and sneaked out of her room. Little does she know, her mother followed her to the airport. At the airport, Joanneâ€™s mother stopped her but she already made up her mind. Her mother is not happy about her decision, but at the same time, she wants the best for her daughter.
